Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. 
For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa, and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. 
Access to bank accounts enable households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other finance services. 
Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

The machine learning model helps to predict using certain data input to
find out before hand if a person is likely to open a bank account.
